OpenDepthâ€”Extending the Web
=========

OpenDepth is a client server application that brings Kinect SDK methods and data to the web.
The server is written on C# and built on top of Kinect SDK 1.5,
The client is a written in JavaScript and uses the briliant Three.js webGL rendering engine.

## Features: ##
### Skeleton Tracking ###
Live stream multiple skeletons joints position data (X,Y,Z) including quaternion joint rotation.

### Point Cloud ###
RGBDepth data for a 640X480 rezolution "snapshot" taken with Kinect. 307200 vectors are sent from Kinect to the browser via HTML5 WebSocketss.

## Instalation: ##
+ Download anf install Kinect SDK from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/developer-downloads.aspx. Make sure that your Kinecct camera is installed properly by running one of the SDK demos 
+ Run OpenDepth.exe from build/server
+ Open index.html from build/client into a modern browser
When the server and client are connected a "Connection successful." message will appear on console.

There are 2 prerecorded demos that you can run without without a Kinect on any OS

## Cool things to come: ##
+ Request/Send API
+ Custom multiple touch zones, turn any surface into a touchscreen
+ Skeleton and point cloud data recording and saving
+ Mesh creation from point cloud
+ Face tracking
+ Iterative Closest Point integration for 3d objects scan 
+ More Kinect SDK methodes and data exposed

## About: ##
This code is part of a 24 hours hackatlon. We cut many corners and neglect proper testion. The server will also be relised as an open source once we clean it up.
